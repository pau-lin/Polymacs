# Polymacs
Polymacs is a SuperMemo-inspired Emacs package intended for self-learners. SuperMemo (https://www.super-memory.com/) is a learning method and software developed by Piotr Wo≈∫niak since 1985, which has introduced and implemented many techniques for lifelong and autodidactic learners, such as incremental learning and spaced repetition. We have adapted some of these techniques into the Emacs environment, taking advantage of its rich ecosystem.

Polymacs aims to be fast, scalable, future-proof, and modular, providing a robust open-source solution for self-taught learners, adaptable to their individual needs.

## Current state
The package is currently in an totally unstable and incomplete state, with core functionalities still under development.
