The learning tree is divided into two types of elements:

- Topic refers to elements containing data used to familiarize oneself with a concept or domain. They can be long (almost the length of a full file) or short (fews lines), depending on the level of atomization. In simple terms: an element is considered a topic when it does not involve active recall. For example, a topic could be a section of text that you extract for later review and understanding, and it will ultimately be transformed into an item when it reaches a sufficient level of atomization to support active recall.

- Item refers to elements designed to verify that you havenâ€™t forgotten the knowledge. It is based on the active recall process (e.g., cloze cards or question/answer formats). For instance, Anki generally deals only with items.
